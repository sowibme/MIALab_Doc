\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks

\subsection{Segmentation of medical images}
The task of finding all the pixels (or voxels in the 3D case) of a medical image which belong to a given tissue of interest is commonly referred to as segmentation. The outputs of the segmentation of a medical image are normally masks for the different tissues of interest which contain binary information of which regions of an image belong to the specific tissue type. In our case the images are MRI images of healthy brains which are segmented into the classes whitematter, greymatter and the ventricles which is shown in figure \ref{fig:brainseg}. Segmentation of medical images can be done manually or with the aid of software in a manual, semi-automatic or fully-automatic manner. Often the output of segmentation pipelines and algorithms are compared and validated against segmentations done by an expert (e.g. radiologist) which are referred to as the ground truth.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/mer}
\caption{Example segmentation of a healthy brain T2 weighted image: On the left side is the unsegmented image, on the right side the segmentation with white being classified as ventricles, darkgrey the whitematter and lightgray the greymatter.}
\label{fig:brainseg}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Value of automatic segmentation}
A solid segmentation of medical images into regions of interest is the key and basic requirement for many further tasks. For instance any realtime computer assisted surgery or image guided surgery relies on the solid segmentation of medical imaging. Since medical images as computed tomography scans or MRI images often contain a multitude of 2D images (called Z-slices), the manual segmentation takes precious time of an expert and is a very tedious task. The idea of robust and autonomous segmentation of medical images is therefore  very appealing. The importance is further emphasized due to the fact that segmented and labelled data can be used together with supervised machine learning algorithms to train models and make predictions for all sorts of applications.

\subsection{Preprocessing}
In most segmentation algorithms or integrated pipelines there is an early stage which deals with the preparation of the data. This is referred to as preprocessing stage or simply preprocessing. In this stage, the raw data is edited, filtered and transformed in order to remove noise and biases and to make the data more comparable. Good preprocessing of the data will make the later stages of the segmentation pipeline to perform better and will thus increase the whole segmentation performance.

% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be

% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a

%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.


\section{Materials and Methods}
In this chapter the methods used are briefly described. All the experiments have been conducted using the image segmentation pipeline and the dataset which were provided. For the individual experiments only the pre preprocessing part of the pipeline was adjusted, all the other stages were left untouched. As the calculations, depending on the experiment, took very long to complete, the most part of them were executed on the university cluster.

\subsection{Overview and pipeline}
The segmentation pipeline provided is written in python and uses a decision tree for the classification. Figure \ref{fig:pipeline} shows an overview of the different stages of the pipeline. As mentioned before, this work is only concerned with the influence of preprocessing stage, and therefore all other stages of the pipeline have not been touched.
\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/pipeline}
\caption{Overview of the different stages of the given segmentation pipeline. The MRI images are aligned in the registration stage and preprocessed. In a next stepg various features are extracted to either train a model during train phase or for the classification in the test phase. After classification postprocessing is applied to increase the segmentation quality.}
\label{fig:pipeline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Goal and strategy}
The main goal of this work is to evaluate and quantize the influence of of different preprocessing steps on the overall segmentation performance of the described pipeline. Our basic strategy was to first disable all preprocessing and run the segmentation pipeline on the given data. The result of this run was then considered to be the reference segmentation performance. In further runs, different filters and operations have then been applied to the image data during the preprocessing stage. The segmentation results of these runs are then compared to the reference segmentation performance. This technique allows to get an idea of the influence on the segmentation performance of specific preprocessing steps.

\subsection{Dataset}
The given dataset, on which all the experiments have been conducted on, consists of unrelated and healthy brain MRI T1 and T2 weighted images of one hundred patients out of the Human Connectome Project data set. Additonally for all the brain images seperate ground truth masks are available for whitematter, greymatter and the ventricles. For all experiments the dataset was split into a training and test set with a 70/30 ratio. The images of the dataset are non-skull stripped and defaced for anonymization, which can be seen on left image of figure \ref{fig:brainseg}.

\subsection{Reference}
As a reference base for comparison the unprocessed MRI images have been segmented with the given pipeline. Therefore the reference segmentation performance is the result of feeding the raw (but registered) images directly into the later stages of the pipeline without any preprocessing (no bias field correction, no skull stripping, no filtering). The output of this is refferred to as \textit{00raw} in figure \ref{fig:result}.

\subsection{Skull stripping}
The skulls in the images are removed also during the preprocessing stage as they are of no interest for our purposes.

\subsection{Bias field correction}
MRI images are often corrupted by a bias field signal which is induced by inhomogeneities of the magnetic fields of the MRI device. There exist strategies to reconstruct and simulate this bias field and then correct grayscale image accordingly during preprocessing. In our case we were also provied with the already bias field corrected versions of the image data. The performance of the segmentation pipeline with only bias field corrected data (no further preprocessing) can be seen as \textit{01biasfieldcorr} in figure \ref{fig:result}. All calculations except the reference (\textit{00raw}) were conducted on the bias field corrected data.

\subsection{Z Score Normalization}
In order to make data more comparable it is commonly normalized. To achieve this, the data $x$ is transformed according to equation \ref{eq:ZSCORE} with $\mu$ being the mean and $\sigma$ the standard deviation of the data. When applied to an image, this results in the intensity distribution of the image being zero centered with $\sigma = 1$.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ZSCORE}
    z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}{}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Filtering}
Different filters have been applied to the images during the preprocessing stage.
\subsubsection{Gaussian}
In order to smooth the data simple gaussian blurring, with different values for sigma, has been applied to the images.
\subsubsection{Median}
Median filtering can be used to remove impulse noise and has the benefit to keep information about edges in the data. Mean filtering or Gaussian filtering tends to blur the edges.
\subsubsection{Bilateral}

\subsection{Performance Measure}
A commonly used performance measure for medical image segmentations is the dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The DSC is a good estimator about the overall performance and exactness of a segmentation. The coefficient is  calculated according to equation \ref{eq:DSC}, with $S$ being the segmented voxels and $G$ the voxels of the ground truth. The DSC is obtained by dividing the doubled intersection between $S$ and $G$ by the sum of both volumes. A DSC value of 1.0 corresponds to both volumes $S$ and $G$ overlapping completely and is therefore the result of a pefect segmentation. Figure \ref{fig:dice} depicts the 2D case and the sets consist of pixels. In the case of MRI data we are dealing with 3D sets which consist of voxels. For each of the brain regions we are interested in, namely whitematter, greymatter and the ventricles, the DSC is calculated seperately using seperate ground truths $G$ and segmented voxels $S$.

\begin{figure}[!t]

\caption{Regions involved to calculate the DSC. $S$ is the set of segmented pixels and therefore the output of the segmentation pipeline. $G$ is the set of pixels of the ground truth data.$S$, $G$ and the intersection between the two sets are used to calculate the DSC value.}
\label{fig:dice}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:DSC}
    DSC = \frac{2\left |S\cap G  \right |}{\left |S  \right | + \left |G  \right |}
\end{equation}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Computation order}

For the test, we have always applied the filter after the bias field correction and skull stripping.
If we have applied more than one filter, then we label it in the order we have calculated. That means when we wrote Zscore-Median. We have first used the Zscore and then the median.

MedianR2 means Median with radius 2; the same is by GaussianS3 that indicate Gaussian with Sigma is 3.

\section{Discussion}

We can see that the preprocessing step has a large influence on the output. When we applied the Skull striping and the Z-score we have very good results.
We were surprised that the bias field correction does not make the dice better in our case it has a negative impact.
He makes the variance larger.

The Median filter with Radius three helps a lot to classified better the ventricles. When we look at the white and grey matter the median, how also the Gaussian, do not improve the results. That allows an assumption that in this part we haven't gaussian noise or outliers.

The bilateral filter has two tuning parameters, which we have not tuned actually. Maybe with the optimal parameter, we also go in the range from the Z-score.


\section{Conclusion}
With the preprocessing step is it easy to tune your outcome. But you make a compromise for the different class. The filter who push up the ventricle reduce the dice from the other class or the other way around. 

The bias field correction was in our case not useful and can be removed from the pipeline.
